            Hello, I'm Jean Francisco Jiménez.
        p.pharagraph.
            Well, that's not my name, but it's similar. 
            I'm a Computer Systems Engineer and in the past I had worked as a Web Developer.<br/>
            I'm interested in building and developing Complex Systems and Smart Software for fun applications.
            I wanna build IT solutions to make the fusion/intersection between the virtual and the real World.<br/>
            I consider myself a creative, dedicated, inquisitive and responsible person.
            If the tasks are of my interest, you can be trust that I made them in the best way.
            <br/>
            <br/>
